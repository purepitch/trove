 - add usage information to the README.  How is one supposed to use the
   program?
 - first start -> look in home dir for a .trove dir with passwd file
 - do you want to start a password file? (if not available)
 - multiple repositories
 - how does search work with multiple repos?
 - use a db such as sqlite instead of a simple text file for the passwd repo?
 - handle privelege levels for users e.g. a new group member should only
   read *some* passwords but not others
